# 🚀 DEPLOYMENT FIX - QUICK SUMMARY

## ✅ Problem Identified & Fixed!

Your Render deployment had an issue with the server path configuration. **It's now fixed!**

---

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

Render was looking for: `/opt/render/project/src/server.js`
But server was at: `/opt/render/project/server/server.js`

**Error:** `Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/server.js'`

---

## ✨ What's Been Fixed

Updated `render.yaml` to specify correct root directories:
- Backend root: `server`
- Frontend root: `client`
- Removed `cd` commands from build/start commands
