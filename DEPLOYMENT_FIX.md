# 🔧 DEPLOYMENT FIX - Server Path Configuration

## ❌ Problem Encountered

Render deployment failed with error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/server.js'
```

This happened because Render was looking for the server in the wrong directory.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

Updated `render.yaml` to specify the correct root directories:

### Changed From:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    buildCommand: cd server && npm install
    startCommand: cd server && npm start
    
  - type: static
    buildCommand: cd client && npm install && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: client/dist
```

### Changed To:
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    root: server
    buildCommand: npm install
    startCommand: npm start
    
  - type: static
    root: client
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: dist
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

✅ Backend will start from correct directory (`/server`)
✅ Frontend will build from correct directory (`/client`)
✅ Render will find `server.js` at correct location
✅ No more "Cannot find module" errors

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Re-deploy on Render (Recommended)
1. Go to your Render.com dashboard
2. Click on the backend service
3. Click "Redeploy" or "Clear cache & redeploy"
4. Wait for deployment to complete
5. Should succeed now! ✅

### Option 2: Delete and Create New Services
1. Delete existing services on Render
2. Create new Web Service for backend
3. Create new Static Site for frontend
4. Pull latest code with the fix
